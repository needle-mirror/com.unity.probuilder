# Create a mesh with the Poly Shape tool

To create a custom shape, use the **Poly Shape** tool. Draw a 2D custom shape (depth and width) and then extrude that shape into a 3D mesh to define its height.

To create a custom mesh:

1. Activate the **New PolyShape** tool in one of the following ways:
	* In the **Tools** overlay, click the **New PolyShape** icon.
    * In the main menu, go to **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Editors** > **New PolyShape**.
1. To create the outer bounds of your mesh, click in the **Scene** view to create control points.
    > **Note:** You can click directly on another surface to create an outgrowth, even when that surface is on the y-axis.
