Editor windows provide [features](tool-panels.md) with extended functionality. For example, you can use the UV Editor window to perform advanced texture manipulations, including texture mapping, UV unwrapping, and tiling.

To access these windows, use the [ProBuilder menu](menu.md) or [keyboard shortcuts](hotkeys.md).
