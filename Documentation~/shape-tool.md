# New Shape and Edit Shape tools

To add built-in ProBuilder shapes, use the **New Shape** tool.

## Create a shape

To create a new shape:

1. Initiate the New Shape tool in one of the following ways:

    * In the **Tools** overlay, click the **New Shape** icon. A short click creates the selected shape; a long click opens a selection menu to choose a different shape.
    * In the main menu, go to **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Editors** > **New Shape** and select a shape.
1. Draw points in the **Scene** view to create the 2D outline of the shape. To help you draw in an exact location, use [**Snap to Grid**](snap-to-grid.md).
1. When you connect the last point to the first point, you can extrude the shape to create a 3D object.

## Edit a shape

To edit an existing shape:

1. Select the shape in the **Scene** view.
1. In the **Tools** overlay, set the active context to ProBuilder. 
1. In the **Tools** overlay, click **Edit ProBuilder Shape** to:
    * Open the **Shape Settings** window. Refer to [Shape settings](#shape-settings)
    * Activate an element selection (face, edge, or vertex) mode and redesign the shape. 

## Shape settings

Each shape has its own settings. To access the settings for a shape, select the shape in the **Scene** view and click **Edit Shape** in the **Tools** overlay to open the **Shape Settings** window. These settings are also available in the **Inspector** window.
