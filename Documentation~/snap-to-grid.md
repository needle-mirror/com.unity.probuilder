# Snap to grid

To draw an exact size and location when creating a new shape or PolyShape, use the **Grid Snapping** option to guide your mouse along the grid as you draw. 

To enable grid snapping, do one of the following:

* Set constant grid snapping:
    1. In the **Tool Settings** overlay, set **Tool Handle Rotation** to **Global**. 
    1. In the **Grid and Snap** overlay, activate **Grid Snapping**.
* Hold **Ctrl** (macOS: **Cmd**) as you draw.

> **Tip:** To set the size of these increments, use the **Increment Snap** property in the [**Grid and Snap**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GridSnapping.html#grid-and-snap) overlay.
