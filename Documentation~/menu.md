# The ProBuilder menu

Use the ProBuilder menu to access most of the ProBuilder editors, actions, tools, and features that are only available through this menu. For example, you can repair and debug ProBuilder, or access the experimental [Boolean operations](boolean.md).

##  Repair

Repair problems with ProBuilder meshes in the scene.

| **Menu item** | **Description** |

## Export

[Export selected ProBuilder Meshes](workflow-exporting.md) in various formats. 

| **Menu item** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Export Asset** | Saves the selection as a Unity mesh `.asset` files. This format is only readable in Unity. |

| **Export Ply** | Exports the selected object(s) as `.ply` files (Stanford PLY, or Polygon File Format). This format is generally supported and very extensible. It supports quads and vertex colors, but not multiple materials. |
| **Export Stl Ascii** | Exports the selected object(s) as ASCII `.stl` files (stereolithography, standard tessellation, or standard triangle format). This is a widely supported format, generally used in CAD software or 3D printing. It only supports Triangle geometry. |
| **Export Stl Binary** | Exports the selected object(s) as Binary `.stl` files (stereolithography, standard tessellation, or standard triangle format). This is a widely supported format, generally used in CAD software or 3D printing. It only supports Triangle geometry. |
